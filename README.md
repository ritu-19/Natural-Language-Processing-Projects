# Natural-Language-Processing-Projects

## Projects Covered:

1. <b> Predicting Tags on Stack Overflow: </b> <p>The aim of the project is to predict tags on Stack Overflow using Linear Models. To tackle the problem, multilabel classification approach is followed. </p>

2. <b> Named Entity Recognition on Twitter Using LSTMs: </b> <p>In this project, a recurrent neural network, particularly Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTMs) is built to recognize the named entities ( extracting entities such as organizations, locations etc. from text) from Twitter.</p>

3.<b>Identifying duplicate Questions on Stack Overflow using Word Embeddings: </b><p>In this project, duplicate questions from StackOverflow are identified using the word embedding of the questions (similarities between the questions are calculated).</p>

4. <b>Sequence to Sequence Model to build a calculator: </b><p> A Calculator is built for evaluating the arithmetic expressions using sequence-to-sequence model.</p>
